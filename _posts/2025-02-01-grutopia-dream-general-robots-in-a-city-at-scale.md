Abstract: Recent works have been exploring the scaling laws in the field of Embodied AI.
Given the prohibitive costs of collecting real-world data, we believe the Simulation-
to-Real (Sim2Real) paradigm is a crucial step for scaling the learning of embodied
models. This paper introduces project GRUtopia, the first simulated interactive
3D society designed for various robots. It features several advancements: (a)
The scene dataset, GRScenes, includes 100k interactive, finely annotated scenes,
which can be freely combined into city-scale environments. In contrast to previous
works mainly focusing on home, GRScenes covers 89 diverse scene categories,
bridging the gap of service-oriented environments where general robots would
be initially deployed. (b) GRResidents, a Large Language Model (LLM) driven
Non-Player Character (NPC) system that is responsible for social interaction, task
generation, and task assignment, thus simulating social scenarios for embodied AI
applications. (c) The benchmark, GRBench, supports various robots but focuses on
legged robots as primary agents and poses moderately challenging tasks involving
Object Loco-Navigation, Social Loco-Navigation, and Loco-Manipulation. We
hope that this work can alleviate the scarcity of high-quality data in this field and
provide a more comprehensive assessment of Embodied AI research. The project
