We are excited to announce Phi-4-multimodal and Phi-4-mini, the newest models in Microsoftâ€™s Phi family of small language models (SLMs). These models are designed to empower developers with advanced AI capabilities. Phi-4-multimodal, with its ability to process speech, vision, and text simultaneously, opens new possibilities for creating innovative and context-aware applications. Phi-4-mini, on the other hand, excels in text-based tasks, providing high accuracy and scalability in a compact form. Now available in Azure AI Foundry, HuggingFace, and the NVIDIA API Catalog where developers can explore the full potential of Phi-4-multimodal on the NVIDIA API Catalog, enabling them to experiment and innovate with ease.
