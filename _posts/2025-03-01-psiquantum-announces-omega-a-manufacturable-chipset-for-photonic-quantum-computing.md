PsiQuantum announces Omega, a quantum photonic chipset purpose-built for utility-scale quantum computing. Featured in a newly published paper in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08820-7), the chipset contains all the advanced components required to build million-qubit-scale quantum computers and deliver on the profoundly world-changing promise of this technology. Every photonic component is demonstrated with beyond-state-of-the-art performance. The paper shows high-fidelity qubit operations, and a simple, long-range chip-to-chip qubit interconnect â€“ a key enabler to scale that has remained challenging for other technologies.
