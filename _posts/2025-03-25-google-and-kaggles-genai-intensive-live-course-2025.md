From March 31 through April 4, 2025, Google experts will go through foundational gen AI topics like prompt engineering and embeddings, and answer your questions through daily livestreams. Coursework will include AI-generated podcasts using NotebookLM, whitepapers by Google experts and practical code labs for hands-on experience with Gemini and other services. You’ll be able to connect with the community and Google experts in a dedicated Discord chat. At the end of the course, we’re giving participants a chance to apply all learned skills to a practical gen AI challenge through a capstone project.
