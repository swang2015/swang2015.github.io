We introduce RoboVerse, a comprehensive framework comprising a simulation platform, a synthetic dataset, and unified benchmarks. Our simulation platform supports multiple simulators and robotic embodiments, enabling seamless transitions between different environments. The synthetic dataset, featuring high-fidelity physics and photorealistic rendering, is constructed through multiple approaches including migration from public datasets, policy rollout, and motion planning, etc. enhanced by data augmentation. Additionally, we propose unified benchmarks for imitation learning and reinforcement learning, enabling consistent evaluation across different levels of generalization.
