We present Tencent Hunyuan3D-2.0, a powerful large-scale 3D asset creation system that generates high-quality textured 3D assets. The generative model consists of two main components: a foundation shape generative model and a large-scale texture synthesis model. The shape generative model, built on a scalable diffusion transformer architecture, aims to create geometry that aligns with specific conditions, laying a solid foundation for various downstream applications. Benefiting from strong geometric and diffusion priors, the texture synthesis model produces high-resolution and vibrant texture maps and is tolerant to painting either generated or real-world meshes.
