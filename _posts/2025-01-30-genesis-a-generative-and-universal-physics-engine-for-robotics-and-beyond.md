Genesis is a physics platform designed for general-purpose Robotics/Embodied AI/Physical AI applications. It is simultaneously multiple things:

1. A universal physics engine re-built from the ground up, capable of simulating a wide range of materials and physical phenomena.
2. A lightweight, ultra-fast, pythonic, and user-friendly robotics simulation platform.
3. A powerful and fast photo-realistic rendering system.
4. A generative data engine that transforms user-prompted natural language description into various modalities of data.

Powered by a universal physics engine re-designed and re-built from the ground up, Genesis integrates various physics solvers and their coupling into a unified framework. This core physics engine is further enhanced by a generative agent framework that operates at an upper level, aiming towards fully automated data generation for robotics and beyond.
