Abstract: We introduce Visual Reinforcement Fine-tuning (Visual-RFT), the first comprehensive adaptation of Deepseek-R1's RL strategy to the multimodal field. We use the Qwen2-VL-2/7B model as our base model and design a rule-based verifiable reward, which is integrated into a GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning framework to enhance the performance of LVLMs across various visual perception tasks. ViRFT extends R1's reasoning capabilities to multiple visual perception tasks, including various detection tasks like Open Vocabulary Detection, Few-shot Detection, Reasoning Grounding, and Fine-grained Image Classification.
