Version control is an important concept in Software Engineering because deleloping software is an accumulative work and you need to properly manage all the files and their changes. With a good _Version Control System_ (VCS), you can compare changes over time or revert the entire project back to a previous state. It facilitates collaboration within a group of people on the same project in different ways simultaneously. 

Git is a most popular VCS at present. The image below shows the commands that you might have been familiar with. Git has many more practical functions and here lists some.

### Initializing a Repository

```shell
    $ git init
    $ git init <PROJECT-NAME>       # make a new directory
    $ git clone <REMOTE-REPO-URL>   # download project from url

    $ git submodule add <URL>       # add a repository as subdirectory
    $ git submodule init            # initialize submodule's local configuration
    $ git submodule update          # fetch the repo
```

### Recording Changes to Repository

```shell
    $ git add <FILE>/<FOLDER>/.     # stage new files
    $ git add -p <FILE>             # selectively stage new files
    $ git rm <FILE>                 # stage removals
    $ git mv <FILE_FROM> <FILE_TO>  # stage renamings

    $ git update-index --assume-unchanged <FILE>    # assume file unchanged

    $ git commit -m <MSG>           # commit file changes from staging area to repository
    $ git commit --amend ...        # change last commit
    $ git commit -a ...             # skip staging area and commit changes directly from workspace

    $ git reset HEAD <FILE> ...     # unstage files
    $ git checkout -- <FILE>        # revert files back to its latest revision

    $ git stash <-u>                # hide staged/untracked changes to stack to make workspace clean
    $ git stash list                # check stash list
    $ git stash apply <stash@{2}>   # apply last stashed change or a selected one
    $ git stash pop                 # apply stashed change and drop it from the stack
```

### Working with Remotes

```shell
    $ git remote -v                 # show all remote repos
    $ git remote add <REPO> <URL>   # add new remote repo
    $ git remote show origin        # remote repo's info

    $ git fetch <REMOTE-REPO>       # sync local repo with remote
    $ git merge <REMOTE>/<BRANCH>   # merge local with remote
    $ git pull <REMOTE> <BRANCH>    # pull = fetch + merge

    $ git push <REMOTE> <BRANCH>    # save changes to remote repo
    $ git push -f <REMOTE>          # save changes to remote even if having conflict
```

### Branch and Tag

```shell
    $ git branch <-a/-r>            # list local/all/remote branches
    $ git branch <NEW> <COMMIT>     # create new branch/based on commit
    $ git checkout <BRANCH>         # switch to a branch
    $ git branch -d/-dr <BRANCH>    # delete a local/remote branch

    $ git merge <BRANCH>            # merge a branch to the current one. sometimes you have to 
                                    # resolve merge conflict manually and submit the commit.
    $ git rebase <BRANCH>           # move changes of current branch onto top of a selected one

    $ git tag                       # list tags
    $ git tag <NEW> <COMMIT>        # create new tag/based on commit
    $ git tag -a v1.4 -m "my 1.4"   # add annotation
```

### Checking Information

```shell
    $ git status                    # status of modified files

    $ git log                       # history of current branch 
    $ git log -3 --all              # the last 3 records, all branches
    $ git log --stat                # show statistics for files modified in each commit
    $ git log --pretty=format:"%h %ad %s (%an)" --date=short | tail -n 10
                          # first 10 commits, other pretty formats: --oneline --decorate --graph

    $ git show <COMMIT>             # all file changes of a commit
    $ git show <COMMIT>:<FILE>      # a file change of a commit

    $ git diff                      # difference between workspace and staging area
    $ git diff HEAD                 # difference between uncommitted files and the latest commit
    $ git diff --cached             # difference between staging area and the latest commit
    $ gid diff <COMMIT1> <COMMIT2>  # difference between two commits

    $ git blame <FILE>              # the formation of current file (when and by whom)
    $ git shortlog -sn              # show users and corresponding count of commits
```

### Reverting to and Rewriting History

```shell
    $ git reset <COMMIT>            # HEAD is reset and files are unstaged
    $ git reset <COMMIT> -- <FILE>
    $ git reset --soft <COMMIT>     # HEAD is reset and files are still staged
    $ git reset --hard <COMMIT>     # HEAD is reset and changes are removed

    $ git rebase -i HEAD~3          # can reorder commits, change message, squash or split commits
```
